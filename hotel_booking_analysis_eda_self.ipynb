        "\n",
        "**5. stay in weekend nights\" has a correlation of 0.24 with \"lead time\":** This suggests a weak positive linear relationship between the number of weekend nights stayed and the lead time. As the lead time increases, the number of weekend nights stayed tends to increase slightly.\n",

        "**6. \"stay in week nights\" has a correlation of 0.31 with \"lead time\":** This indicates a weak positive linear relationship between the number of week nights stayed and the lead time. As the lead time increases, the number of week nights stayed tends to increase slightly.\n",

        "**7. \"stay in week nights\" has a correlation of 0.56 with \"stay in weekend nights\":** This suggests a moderate positive linear relationship between the number of week nights stayed and the number of weekend nights stayed. When guests stay more week nights, they also tend to stay more weekend nights, which is a logical relationship.\n",
